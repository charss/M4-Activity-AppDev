			<p>Included in the UNESCO World Heritage Natural Monuments list, the Chocolate Hills of Bohol are a geomorphic wonder and truly a sight to behold. It is one of the best places in the Philippines to offer a unique landscape, with its 1,268 cone-shaped hills that turn chocolatey brown during the dry season, hence its name.</p>

			<p>The limestone hills vary in size but almost look similar in shape and range from 30 to 120 meters in height. Itâ€™s a must-add in any itinerary for Bohol trips.</p>

			<p>El Nido in Palawan is most famous for its paradise-like islands and lagoons, but a 45-minute ride away through a land tour from its main town takes you to another idyllic destination: Nacpan Beach.</p>

			<p>Island hopping escapades in El Nido should not be missed. But after a jam-packed day of visiting coves, white-sand beach pockets, limestone cliffs, a trip to relaxing Nacpan Beach is highly recommended and deserves a spot in your itinerary of things to see and do in El Nido.</p>

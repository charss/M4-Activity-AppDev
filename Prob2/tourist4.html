			<p>Long hailed as one of the best beaches in the entire world, Boracayâ€™s claim to fame is its 4-kilometer stretch of pure white, powdery sand called White Beach.</p>

			<p>Cliche as it sounds, but White Beach is truly postcard-perfect, with tall coconut trees lined up and crystal-clear calm waters rounding up its unmatched beauty, making it the top attraction in Boracay trips.</p>
